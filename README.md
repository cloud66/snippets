Deploy Hook Snippets

Below is a bare-bone example of using a snippet with the required fields - it will execute the Cloud 66 Node snippet as the first thing on all production servers.

```
production: # Environment
  first_thing: # Hook point
    - snippet: cloud66/node # Hook type
      target: any # Hook fields
      sudo: true # Needed to install a package
      execute: true # Must be set to true for all snippets
```

## weave_scope

If you want to install [weavescope](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-scope/) on your Docker stack use the following *last_thing* hook.
```
production: # Environment or your choice
  last_thing: # Importent to run the weavescope hook as the last thing during server deployment
    - snippet: cloud66/weave_scope # our weavescope snippet
      target: any 
      sudo: true 
      execute: true
```

*Warning:* Weavescope will run on port 4040 which is not exposed to the outside world. If you want to access the UI change your firewall settings allowing traffic to port 4040. Make sure only you can access weavescope from your ip-address. With weavescope you can control all your running process and excute inside running containers. Take good care of those powers!
